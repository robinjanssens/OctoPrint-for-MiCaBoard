Pull Requests
-------------

1. Please create all pull requests against the `devel` branch.
2. Create **one pull request per feature/bug fix**.
3. Create a custom branch for your feature/bug fix and use that as base for your pull request. Pull requests directly against your version of `devel` will be closed.
4. In your pull request's description, state what your pull request is doing, as in, what feature does it implement, what bug does it fix.
